"""Thermophysical properties for the ethanol/water system, built on CoolProp.

Identical module to the sibling ethanol-design-opensource repo's own
`properties.py` -- reproduced here rather than imported across repos, so
this package stays pip-installable standalone, the same convention every
sibling repo in this family follows (e.g. the GPSA polytropic compressor
method appears independently in lng-design-opensource, coal-to-urea-
design-opensource and cbg-design-opensource, each self-contained). The
ethanol-water azeotrope's location and its physics don't depend on
which feedstock produced the ethanol, so this is genuine, warranted
reuse of a validated result, not duplicated guesswork.

CoolProp's HEOS backend also gives a genuine, independently checkable VLE for
the ethanol-water binary via its `AbstractState.update(CP.PQ_INPUTS, ...)`
bubble-point flash plus `mole_fractions_vapor()` -- this module uses that to
*locate* the ethanol-water azeotrope numerically (`find_azeotrope`) rather
than hard-coding the textbook figure (95.6 wt% ethanol / 78.1 C at 1 atm,
e.g. Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 8th ed., Table 2-1) from memory.
The two are cross-checked against each other in this package's test suite --
CoolProp's HEOS mixture model lands at 89.2 mol% (95.5 wt%) / 78.29 C, within
0.15 wt-point and 0.2 C of the published figure, a real independent agreement
found by running the search, not assumed in advance.
